##Modules required:
#Az.Automation
#Az.Accounts
#Az.Resources

##Considerations
#1. Even if Source Control is active in AA, you can still make runbook changes in Cloud. Conflict Resolution: Be cautious when making manual edits. 
#If thereâ€™s a conflict between the repository version and the manually edited version, the latter will overwrite the former during synchronization.
#as per Copilot feedback, AutoSync occurrs every 15 minutes, so there's a delay. For urgent runbook changes, manual sync can be triggered. 
#However during my tests (small Lab) I found all gh changes reflected instantly in the Cloud

#2 To enable Auto Sync when configuring the source control integration with Azure DevOps, you must be the Project Administrator or the GitHub repo owner. Collaborators can only configure Source Control without Auto Sync.
